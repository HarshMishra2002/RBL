The first model that we created i.e. fer_1.h5 had the problem of overfitting. It happened because there were too many conv2D layers one after the other without maxpooling. The reason we removed maxpooling layers is that the image size is already too short and appliying maxpooling layers was making it way more less in dimension that training the model became impossible. (20 epochs)
Now we have a slighlty improved model. In this maxpooling layers are added again but this time in conv2D layers we are using padding to solve the above issue also we have added batchnormalizer. First we are training our data on this model for 20 epochs initially. Still the same problem of overfitting.
